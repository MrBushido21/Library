# Tcl/Tk Package: getfileordirectory

<img src="./getfileordirectory.png" class="img-responsive" width="500">

## Purpose:

This supplement package for Tcl/Tk implements a **drag&drop** enabled file or directory
selection dialog (GUI).

D&D is optional, as it is not supported on all platforms (e.g. for undroidwish/Androidwish,...).

## Usage:

In case, a function or an application can handle either a single file or maybe a directory
(which contains one or more files) the getfileordirectory dialog might be useful.

The getfileordirectory dialog e.g. is integrated in the HelpViewer application.


## Features:

+	Autodetects the file type - in other words: just select whatever filetype you want with the
	Explorer (WIN) / Finder (OSX) and D&D it onto the boxed dialog area.

+	In addition to the file/directory selection functionality, there is also a listbox availabe,
	which manages the **Most recently used files or directories**.

	
## Licence:	

The package has (hopefully) reached a mature state.
Nevertheless, anyone is invited to share ideas for some more improvements whatsoever.
