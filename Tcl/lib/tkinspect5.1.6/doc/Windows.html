The <b>Windows List</b> is <b>tkinspect</b>'s most complicated list.
In addition to the <a href=Lists.html>standard list operations</a>, the
<b>Windows</b> menu contains the following items that control what
information about a window to display:

<ul>
  <li> <b>Window Configuration</b> shows the configuration of the window.
  <li> <b>Window Packing</b> shows the <tt>pack</tt> commands that
       packed the window into its parent.
  <li> <b>Slave Window Packing</b> shows the <tt>pack</tt>
       commands that packed the slaves of the window.
  <li> <b>Window Bindtags &amp; Bindings</b> shows the current
       bindtag order along with the bindings of each of the tags.
  <li> <b>Window Bindtags</b> shows the current bindtag order of the
       window.
  <li> <b>Window Bindings</b> shows just the bindings for the window.
  <li> <b>Window Class Bindings</b> shows the bindings for the
       window's class.
</ul>

The following options avoid common pitfalls in sending back window
values:

<ul>
  <li> <b>Filter Empty Window Options</b> removes window options that
       are empty (<tt>{}</tt>) from values that are sent.  Some Tk
       configuration parameters are displayed as empty, but setting
       them to <tt>{}</tt> can mean something different.  For example,
       canvas <tt>scrollregion</tt>'s.
  <li> <b>Filter Window -class Options</b> removes <tt>-class</tt>
       options from values that are sent.  Setting the window class of
       <tt>frame</tt>'s and
       <tt>toplevel</tt>'s after they've been created is an error.
  <li> <b>Filter Pack -in Options</b> removes <tt>-in</tt> options
       from values that are sent.
</ul>

The following options control when &amp; how windows are retreived:

<ul>
  <li> <b>Get Window Information</b> controls whether or not the
       windows should be retrieved when a new interpreter is selected
       or the lists are updated.  You may want to turn this on if
       getting the list of windows takes a long time.
  <li> <b>Use Feedback When Getting Windows</b> controls whether or
       not the little feedback percentage bar appears when the windows
       list is created.
</ul>
