<center><h1>Lists</h1></center>

The lists are the listboxes just below the <b>Command:</b> entry.
By default, there are three lists:

<ul>
  <li> <a href=Procs.html>Procs</a> is a list of all the Tcl
       procedures in the target application.
  <li> <a href=Globals.html>Globals</a> is a list of the global
       variables of the target application.
  <li> <a href=Windows.html>Windows</a> is a list of the windows
       of the target application.
  <li> <a href=Images.html>Images</a> is a list of the images
       of the target application.
  <li> <a href=Menus.html>Menus</a> is a list of the <tt>menu</tt> widgets
       of the target application.
  <li> <a href=Canvases.html>Canvases</a> is a list of the
       <tt>canvas</tt> widgets of the target application.
</ul>

By default, only the <b>Procs</b>, <b>Globals</b>, and <b>Windows</b>
lists are shown.  You can change this by adding
<tt>tkinspect_show_list</tt> and <tt>tkinspect_remove_list</tt>
commands to <tt>.tkinspect_init</tt> or by setting the option
<tt>*Tkinspect_main.default_lists</tt>.<p>

Each list also has a menu in the menu bar.  (The menu can also be
brought up by pressing <tt>button-3</tt> in the list.)  The menu
contains a set of standard operations, followed by list-specific
operations (if any are available.)  The standard list operations are:

<ul>
  <li> <b>Show a X..</b> brings up a dialog that prompts for the name
       of a proc, global, or window and places the its value in the <a
       href=Value.html>value window</a>.
  <li> <b>Find X...</b> brings up a dialog that searches the list.
  <li> <b>Edit Filter...</b> brings up a dialog that allows editing of
       the list filter.  The list will only displays those items that
       either match or don't match a set of patterns.  (The default
       list of patterns varies for each list type.)
  <li> <b>Update This List</b> updates the contents of this list.
       All the lists can be updated via the <b>File/Update
       Lists</b> menu item.
  <li> <b>Remove This List</b> removes this list from the tkinspect
       window.  A list can also be removed by deselecting its checkbox
       in the <b>File</b> menu.
</ul>
